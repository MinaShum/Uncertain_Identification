# How to do simulation and fit models
This folder hosts the models and codes used in our pipeline for the horse dataset.

- `DistancesR.csv`: This is the csv containing features built bassed on the coordinates.
- `Simulation&LM.R`: This file contains the R code for running a simulation for independent phenotypes and how to run a linear model.
- `VB`: This folder contains a working example using STAN model to fit a variational bayes on one simulation scenario of horse dataset.
