## How to Do Simulation and Fit Models

This folder hosts the models and code used in our pipeline for the **horse dataset**.

- **`DistancesR.csv`**  
  Contains the CSV file with features derived from the coordinates.

- **`Simulation&LM.R`**  
  Includes R code for:
  - Running a simulation for independent phenotypes.
  - Fitting a linear model.

- **`VB`**  
  A folder containing a working example using a Stan model to fit Variational Bayes on one simulation scenario of the horse dataset.
