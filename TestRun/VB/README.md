## Running Variational Bayes

- **Clone this repository** to your local machine.  
- **Open** and run the notebook **`VariationalBayes.ipynb`**.  
  - This will **compile** the Stan model named **`Model.stan`**  
  - And **fit** the model using the data in **`scenario1_1.json`**  

If you run into any **installation errors** (for example, with PyStan), please refer to the official [Stan Variational Inference page](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanpy/users-guide/examples/Variational%20Inference.html) for troubleshooting and setup instructions.
